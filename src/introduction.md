# JoinUs Guide
This is a guide for new members to join the `EZ-HKU`organization. The guide will help you get started with 
- `Git`
- `GitHub` 
- `Github Flow`

and provide you with a small challenge to test your skills. If you are interested in joining our organization, follow the steps below to complete the challenge.

If you are familiar with `Git` or `GitHub` or `Github Flow`, you can skip the guides and go directly to the [challenge](https://join-us.hku.icu/join-us/challenge.html).
