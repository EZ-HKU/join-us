# Github Flow

This guide will help you understand the `GitHub Flow` and how to use it in the projects.

## What is GitHub Flow?
`GitHub Flow` is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly. It is designed around the core idea that a `main` branch should always be deployable. This means that the `main` branch should contain the latest stable version of the project.

## How does it work?
The `GitHub Flow` consists of the following steps:
1. **Create a branch**: When you start working on a new feature or fix a bug, you should create a new branch from the `main` branch. The branch should have a descriptive name that reflects the changes you are making.
2. **Add commits**: Once you have made the changes, you should commit them to the branch. Each commit should be a small, logical change that can be easily reviewed.
3. **Open a pull request**: After you have committed the changes, you should open a pull request to merge the changes into the `main` branch. The pull request should contain a description of the changes and any relevant information.
4. **Discuss and review**: The team should review the changes and discuss any issues or suggestions. The pull request should be updated based on the feedback received.
5. **Merge the changes**: Once the changes have been reviewed and approved, they can be merged into the `main` branch. The `main` branch should always contain the latest stable version of the project.
6. **Deploy**: After the changes have been merged, they can be deployed to the production environment. This ensures that the latest changes are available to the users.
